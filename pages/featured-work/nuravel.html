				<h2 class="topic-h2 bold">Problem</h2>
				<p>Northwestern University provided countless of resources to their incoming students to learn about the university, but many students still had trouble adjusting to the new campus life. <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/campus-life/" target="_blank">Northwestern Campus Life</a> realized that their current resources were not working and wanted to create a new solution that allows incoming students to ask questions about the school life, and experienced students to share answers and advice.</p>

				<p>The committee loved NUravel and wanted to implement it for future incoming students. However, since the design of NUravel is extremely complicated and we didn't work with a developer throughout the project, it will take time to develop. That being said, I've learned more about storytelling, testing and iterating, and I want to continue it. If I had more time, I would conduct testing with more users and get more feedback on the reliability indicators, because they were the toughest features to design.</p>
