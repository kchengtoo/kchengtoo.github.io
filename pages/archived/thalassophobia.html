				<p>Thalassophobia is a simulation designed for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a therapeutic treatment for phobias. Thalassophobia is specifically designed for treating thalassophobia, which is the fear of water or sea travel. Users will navigate the digital space, which they may encounter fearful sea creatures, and find a way out as a way to overcome their fear.</p>

				<p>Fear often limits people from doing certain things they want to do, since their fear would stop them from doing so. The best way to overcome their fears is to overcome it, but it is too risky to put a person into a real-life situation or environment that would provoke their fear, because they might panic and hurt themselves. Hence, we want to create simple simulations with a controlled environment, which can decondition people and reduce anxiety.</p>

			<div class="col col-12 col-md-6 text">
				<p>To create an interactive space designed for CBT, we needed to understand how this therapeutic treatment works. So we worked with USC Student Health to design a simulation that would best address phobias. Here is what we learned:<br>1. It should help people learn to change their perspective.<br>2. Role-play helps increase exposure.<br>3. Immersive experience helps reduce fear responses.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col col-12 col-md-6 text">
				<p>Since there are many types of conditions, we wanted to focus on one in order to create a framework for future designs. We decided to go with thalassophobia, because we have some interesting ideas to treat this phobia. Thalassophobia is the fear of water and sea travel, so we thought we can utilize the dark environment of the sea and the living animals that live in it to create an intriguing digital environment. We did some research and gathered images of sea creatures that we can use as the graphics of the simulation.</p>

				<h2 class="display-5">Could the simulation in Thalassophobia BE any scarier?</h2>
				<p>The objective of Thalassophobia is to treat people's fear of water through a simulation, so we designed the simulation like a mini game. The simulation happens in a deep sea environment where 20 sea creatures are hidden in it. Users will have to find all 20 creatures in order to pass the simulation, which means that users will have to interact with the creatures even if they are scared of it. A flowchart and comprehensive drawing were created to illustrate the simulation.</p>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col col-12 col-md-6 text">
				<p>Since we gathered the images of sea creatures from different sources, all of them have their own style and tone, which creates a disconnection between each creature. However, we wanted all our creatures to be unified and be able fit into an interactive environment. So we photoshopped all the images to a single style.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col col-12 col-md-6 text">
				<p>We were inspired by appearances of Game of Thrones's white walkers, which they have lifeless bodies with blue glowing eyes. It truly strikes fear in the hearts of men whenever they appear and we want to have a similar effect with our simulation whenever users encounter a sea creature. Hence, resulting in our monster-like sea creature.</p>

				<p>Since Thalassophobia is an interactive simulation, we created it as a website. With HTML, CSS and JavaScript, we can make a lot of interesting content for the simulation. However, because this simulation focuses primarily on visualization and interactivity, the website is mostly made out of JavaScript. One of the most complex interaction event is the detection of all 20 sea creatures being hovered. To achieve that, we had to create an identity for each creature, so that the website will know the existences of the sea creatures. Once we created those identities, we linked them together to an event on JavaScript that detects any interaction with these identities.</p>

				<p>One of the most haunting aspects of the ocean is the unknown abyss. While we have already created a deep sea environment, we also want to make the environment as ambiguous as possible and the only thing users can see is whatever their flashlight shines on. This will evoke fear as users explore the environment of Thalassophobia.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col col-12 col-md-6 text">
				<p>However at the same time, we do not want our users to be confused by the total darkness of the environment. Therefore, we created indications in the space that acts as guides to the users. By using the blue glowing eyes of the sea creatures, we created indications for the users to locate the sea creatures and pass the simulation. </p>

The outer shell is also equipped with a LED light inside its head, which lights up and shines through the eyes whenever DrawBot is executing a command.</p>

				<p>I realize that my website may not be the best example of cognitive behavioral therapy, but what I am conveying through my project is that with digital arts, such as web design, we can create therapeutic treatments. My project hinted that the potential of using technology on therapeutic treatments is limitless. With inventions like virtual reality, the immersive experience is even more real, and maybe in the future, there will be technologies that can create immersive experience that uses all five senses. To that point, the cognitive behavioral therapy will be more effective to treat people’s phobias. Thus, this shows that my web design project on thalassophobia treatment speculates that digital arts and technology may be the key to create the perfect cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>
