				<p>Collective Narrative (CN) is a novel social media app that identifies users in a situation and automatically notifies them to participate in a collective storytelling experience. By contributing to the narrative and reading other contributions, it helps users feel a sense of togetherness with their community.

				<h2 class="topic-h2 bold">Problem</h2>
				<p>Going through shared experiences together, like pulling an all-nighter in the library with fellow students before a paper deadline, is an incredible way for communities to bond. However, this sense of togetherness becomes lost when communities go virtual, even though they're still pulling the same all-nighter. We explored how this sense of togetherness can be recreated in collective storytelling experiences, so communities can bond at distance.</p>
				<p class="bold"><span class="project-color-text">Challenge:</span> How might we create a sense of togetherness in social storytelling experiences to help communities bond at distance?</p>
				 <!-- To bridge that gap, our team created a context-aware technology that will help people connect more closely with their communities, through reading and contributing to a multi-faceted narrative about the communityâ€™s mutual experience. -->

				<p>This was an intense project for me, because it was my first HCI research project and the methodologies were significantly different from HCD research. However, I've learned a lot from this project and I'm happy with the results of our study. My research partner and I submitted a <a href="../cscw21c-sub1079.pdf" target="_blank">research paper</a> on this project to <a href="https://cscw.acm.org/2021/" target="_blank">CSCW'21</a> and it had been accepted by the conference committee. We will be creating a poster, which will be presented at a virtual exhibition. So for now, our work continues.</p>
